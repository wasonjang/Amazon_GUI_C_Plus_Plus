To compile my code, simply type make in the terminal. A executable called amazon will appear under the same directory. To run type ./amazon yourdatabasefile. Amazon contains all the menu options. book.cpp contains functions of the book object. movie.cpp contains function of the movie object. clothing.cpp contains function of the movie object. search function uses intersection and union and use .find() which consist of a run time under O(n), so it does not cycle through the entire catalog in the database.
